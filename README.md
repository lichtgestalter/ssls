Star System Lightcurve Simulator<br>
The SSLS calculates the movement and eclipses of celestial bodies and produces a video of this.<br>
Specify mass, radius, position, velocity, direction of movement and luminosity of some stars and planets.<br>
The video shows simultanously a view of the star system from top and from the side and the lightcurve of the system's total luminosity over time.<br>
